## My process


### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://nextjs.org/) - JS framework

### What I learned

This project has heled me learn about the basics of the vue framework. I have become more accustomed to data-binding with vue and working with modularized components.

### Continued development

Now that I am comfortable building reusable components with Vue, I can extent my knowledge to a larger e-commerce application with a fully fleshed out backend and state management like vuex.
